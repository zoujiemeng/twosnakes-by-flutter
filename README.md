<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a snake game powered by Flutter with one or two player mode. Everything you can see in this app is generated by code. The most interesting part for me is I can play the game with a friend and change the color of almost everything at anytime.

### One Player Mode
one player mode is just like traditional snake game, player could use both controller to control the snake, Please refer to the following demo. by the way, the gif compression algorithm lost too much details for this app, it is highly recommended to get app at [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jaytown.twosnakes) or watch [HD video at youtube](https://youtu.be/fRPARjtkeR8).

### Two Player Mode
two player mode is two player control a snake separately to compete for one foodpack using their own controller.

### Change Color
user can change color of almost everything at anytime, and the changes take effect realtime even during the game. In fact, the render rate of widgets is quite high in this app since its a game app, and there is only one red bar(stands for a jank) occurred during a 5 minutes performance test.
